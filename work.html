       <h2>Market Research Specialist at <a href="https:/www.federalsignal.com"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Federal Signal</a> </h2>
       <p> I co-collaborated with business units on customer improvement campaigns
          and utilized Design Thinking methodology to gain deeper insight into customer
          problems. In addition, I designed, managed, and executed research with primary
          and secondary stakeholders. I gathered contextual market intelligence by
          engaging with customers and stakeholders across North America. I analyzed
          and synthesized qualitative and quantitative data to improve the customer
          experience and led customer research in the field for a wide range of
          audiences, discovered insights first-hand through interviews, contextual
          observations, and online research. I performed competitive analysis on various
          companies and identified market trends for website analysis and expansion.
          I created financial business models and generated reports and presented
          findings to Innovation Lab, business units, and C-Suite and collaborated on
           projects within several subsidiaries (Elgin Sweeper Co, Vactor, FS Solutions, Joe
          Johnson Equipment, Federal Signal) and the Federal Signal Innovation Lab Team.
